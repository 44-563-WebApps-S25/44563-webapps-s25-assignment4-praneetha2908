    <h6>Act 1, Scene 3 - The Witches Meet Macbeth</h6>

    <blockquote>
        <b>FIRST WITCH:</b>  
        Where hast thou been, sister?  

        <b>SECOND WITCH:</b>  
        Killing swine.  

        <b>THIRD WITCH:</b>  
        Sister, where thou?  

        <b>FIRST WITCH:</b>  
        A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap,  
        And munch’d, and munch’d, and munch’d.  

        <b>SECOND WITCH:</b>  
        I’ll give thee a wind.  

        <b>THIRD WITCH:</b>  
        Thou’rt kind.  

        <b>FIRST WITCH:</b>  
        And I another.  

        <b>THIRD WITCH:</b>  
        I myself have all the other,  
        And the very ports they blow.  

        <b>MACBETH:</b>  
        So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
